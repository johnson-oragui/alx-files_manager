$ wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-6.0.10.tar.gz
$ tar xzf redis-6.0.10.tar.gz
$ cd redis-6.0.10
$ make
Start Redis in the background with src/redis-server
$ src/redis-server &
Make sure that the server is working with a ping src/redis-cli ping
PONG

Using the Redis client again, set the value School for the key Mine
$ 127.0.0.1:[Port]> set Mine School
$ OK
$ 127.0.0.1:[Port]> get Mine
$ "School"
Kill the server with the process id of the redis-server (hint: use ps and grep)
 
$ ps ax | grep redis-server
$ redis-cli info server | grep process_id
$ redis-cli info server | awk -F: '/^process_id/ {print $2}'


$ kill [PID_OF_Redis_Server]



In the context of the kill command, -9 represents the signal number, and it
specifically refers to the signal named "SIGKILL." Signals are software interrupts
that are used to communicate with processes in Unix-like operating systems.

The -9 option with the kill command sends the SIGKILL signal to the specified process
ID (PID). This signal is a powerful one, and when a process receives SIGKILL, it is
immediately terminated without any chance to perform cleanup or handle the signal.
It forcefully kills the process.

Here's a breakdown of the command you provided:

kill -9 65
kill: The command used to send signals to processes.
-9: The signal option, indicating that the SIGKILL signal should be sent.
65: The process ID (PID) of the process you want to terminate.


So, the command is telling the operating system to forcefully terminate the process
with the PID 65 using the SIGKILL signal. This is often used when a process is
unresponsive or needs to be terminated immediately.
